Title:
Execute_Next_Command is allowed on empty Command_Manager

Description:
Execute_Next_Command takes the Command at the top of the Queue and executes it.
The function itself does not check if the queue is empty before running the execute function and a NullPointerException
will be called if the queue is empty and could potentially cause the overall program to fail.
Calling Execute_Next_Command on an empty Command_Manager will produce this behavior.
The function should first check if Next_Command() is null or if(Queue_Empty) before
calling Execute or catch the exception.

Performance Effect:
Critical- not at the very least catching the exception can potentially lead to a crash.

Requirement Number:
None

Notes:
Proposed solutions-
1.First check to see if queue is empty and throw an exception if it is empty.
2. use a try-catch block when calling execute.
